If there are characters after the last delimiter at the end of the stream, they will be considered a token and therefore, this method will return true. This happens also if there is just a newline (in the case it is not a delimiter). It is possible to avoid this problem, but will affect efficency. Because a \char`\"{}spurious\char`\"{} token will just be ignored by the parser I decided to just leave it as it is.
